abstract: "In a consumer video, there are not only intended objects, which are intentionally captured by the camcorder user, but also unintended objects, which are accidentally framed-in. Since the intended objects are essential to present what the camcorder user wants to express in the video, discriminating the intended objects from the unintended objects are beneficial for many applications, e.g., video summarization, privacy protection, and so forth. In this paper, focusing on human objects, we propose a method for discriminating the intended human objects from the unintended human objects. We evaluated the proposed method using 10 videos captured by 3 camcorder users. The results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully discriminates the intended human objects with 0.45 of recall and 0.80 of precision."
